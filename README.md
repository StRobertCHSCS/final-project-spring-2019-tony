# ICS4U1 Final Project

## Getting Started

As discussed, for the final  project you will be creating a game using Python Arcade.  The first step will be to establish a *backlog* of features that you want your game to have, essentially establishing the objectives for your game.

### Step 1 - Get to know advanced Python Arcade
You've already done some work to familiarize yourself with Python Arcade, however, it is important to go one step further and see what other possibilities exist in Python Arcade.

* Start with the main [Python Arcade Library page](http://arcade.academy/).  There are lots of examples to take in, including a through breakdown of building a platformer game.  
* Next check out the following additional lessons:
    * [Making Shooting Sprites](https://arcade-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/21_shooting_sprites/shooting_sprites.html)
    * [Sprites and Walls](https://arcade-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/22_sprites_and_walls/sprites_and_walls.html)
    * [Array-backed Grids](https://arcade-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/25_array_backed_grids/array_backed_grids.html)
    * [Platformers](https://arcade-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/26_platformers/platformers.html)
    
### Step 2 - Decide on your game
Now that you've reviewed what's possible with Python Arcade, it's time to brainstorm what you want your game to be about.   Discuss this with your partner and write down your ideas.  Think about: 
* what is the player's objective
* what type of game is it - Shooter? Platformer (Think Mario)? Overhead map explorer (think Zelda)?
* user control (keypad, controller, mouse)
* single player, multiplayer (turn based, co-operative, 1v1?)
* how is the player's project being tracked (score, checkpoints, lives)
* aesthetics - what images, sounds, characters are you looking to incorporate.


### Step 3 - Game Backlog Draft
Document all the features that you want your game to have in a backlog in a Google Doc(for now).  This will be the guiding list of to-dos for your project.


### Step 4 - Project Kanban
Create a Kanban board for the project using the *Project* feature in your github repository.  A demo will be provided for this.

# See [back && forth](https://github.com/fakeinc/back-and-forth). It's a private repo for now. But I'll turn it to public when I finish most of it.
